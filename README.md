This Matlab scripts are for the paper *“Optimal experimental design for parameter estimation in the presence of autocorrelated observation noise”*  

* **Figure 1**: Generated using `Plot_Fig1.m` with `phi = 0.02`.
* **Figure 2**: Generated using `Plot_Fig2_1.m` and `Plot_Fig2_2.m`.
* **Figure 3**: Generated using `Plot_Fig3.m`, with optimized points generated by `Plot_Fig3_leftFIM_data.m` and `Plot_Fig3_leftSob_data.m`.
* **Figure 4**: Generated using `Plot_Fig4.m`.
* **Figure 5**: Generated using `Plot_Fig5.m`, with optimized points generated by `Plot_Fig5_leftFIM_data.m` and `Plot_Fig5_leftSob_data.m`.
* **Figure 6**: Generated using `Plot_Fig6_1.m`, `Plot_Fig6_2.m`, and `Plot_Fig6_3.m`, respectively.
* **Figure 7**: Generated using `Plot_Fig7.m` with data produced by `Plot_Fig7_data.m`. The script `Plot_Fig7_data.m` is executed five times, setting `numpoints` to 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively.
* **Figure 8**: Generated using `Plot_Fig8_1.m` and `Plot_Fig8_2.m`, with data generated by `Plot_Fig8_data_FIM.m` and `Plot_Fig8_data_Sob.m`.
* **Figure S1** (in Supplementary Information): Generated using `Plot_FigS1.m` with `phi = 0.1`.
* **Figure S2** (in Supplementary Information): Generated using `Plot_FigS2_1.m`, `Plot_FigS2_2.m`, and `Plot_FigS2_3.m`.
* **Figure S3** (in Supplementary Information): Generated using `Plot_FigS3.m`.

* **Additional Codes**:
  * The scripts in the `GSAT` folder are used for computing Sobol’s index.
  * The `PlatEMO` folder contains optimization codes, including implementations such as the competitive swarm optimizer.
